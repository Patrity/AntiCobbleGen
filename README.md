# AntiCobbleGen
Simple Spigot plugin that prevents the formation of cobblestone and obsidian from lava and water mixing. 
### Be Aware
This stops all `BlockFormEvent` so it will also stop snow from forming in taigas, etc.

## Build
Recommend to import the build.gradle script using IntelliJ. You can then run the task `fatJar` to create a deployable jar for your server.
